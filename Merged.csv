"Next, we examined the role of Rho family GTPases in the << ceramide >>-induced signalling to [[ SRE ]] activation.",ACTIVATOR,[]
"By reporter gene analysis following transient transfections with various plasmids expressing a dominant negative mutant form of Cdc42, Rac1 or RhoA, << C2-ceramide >>-induced [[ SRE ]] activation was shown to be selectively repressed by pEXV-RacN17 encoding a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, suggesting that Rac activity is essential for the signalling cascade of ceramide to the nucleus.",ACTIVATOR,[]
"In a further study to analyse the downstream mediator of Rac in the ceramide-signalling pathway, we observed that either pretreatment with mepacrine, a potent and specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or co-transfection with antisense cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) oligonucleotide repressed the << C2-ceramide >>-induced [[ SRE ]] activation selectively, implying a critical role of cPLA2 in C2-ceramide-induced signalling to nucleus.",ACTIVATOR,[]
